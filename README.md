> _**I speak your language, you speak mine**_

An MVP app for finding partners to practice foreign language conversation skills. Just about as safe as CraigsList.

To test it out, make an account and search for (fake) English or French speakers in Montreal. Add practicing languages in your profile to use the vocab feature and let others know what you can offer and what you're looking for.

*Note: This app is public and anyone will be able to see your profile info / meetup requests. Your chats are real. Use with discretion.__I recommend using fake email and name data__. Haven't implemented account deletion yet.*

*Another note: This app was built only for practicing purposes... it's incomplete and could use some styling love. Maybe someday.*

## Features
### Partner search
Find locals that want to practice the language[s] you know and are knowledgable in language[s] you are trying to practice

### Request and manage meetups
Settle on a place to meetup and let BonjourHi keep track of who you're meeting when

### Chat
Message in realtime with potential partners (or past buddies)

### Collect vocab
Start collecting vocab you think is cool. Don't know how to pronounce that French word? Let BonjourHi read it out to you. Don't know how to spell that Chinese word? Let BonjourHi write it down for you with through speech recognition.
